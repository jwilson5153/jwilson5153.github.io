                <h2>Bolivar History</h2>
                <p>
                    Bolivar has existed as a city since Nov. 10, *1835, when proclaimed as such by the Polk County Court
                    and
                    designated as the county seat. Bolivar and Polk County in 1985 celebrated their sesquicentennial.
                </p>
                <div id="stage"><img src="images/overlandstage.jpg" alt="overland stage" width="320" height="201"></div>
                <p>Bolivar was organized as a fourth-class city Feb. 15, 1881. The settlement which was to become
                    Bolivar
                    developed along the trail used by the Overland Stage, hence the reason Bolivar’s streets don’t run
                    true
                    north and south, instead being offset about 22 degrees to the west.</p>

                <p>The location of Bolivar as a settlement was also directly related to Keeling Spring, located behind
                    the
                    Bolivar Post Office and next to the Bolivar Herald-Free Press office. That spring is now mostly
                    covered
                    by a concrete monument that commemorates the importance of the spring to the location of Bolivar.
                    Back
                    in the year of 1823, Ezekiel Polk and Thomas Hardeman settled with their families in an area of
                    southwestern Tennessee that was known as Hickory Valley. A new county was organized there later on
                    and
                    named Hardeman County after Thomas Hardeman, the early settler.</p>
                <div id="simon"><img src="images/simonStatue320.jpg" alt="Simon Bolivar Statue" width="320"
                        height="242"></div>
                <p>
                    The county seat of justice was named
                    Hatchie at the beginning, but as news began to reach the United States of the heroic military feats
                    which were being achieved in South America by General Simon Bolivar, the people of the young county
                    took
                    steps to change the name of their county seat from Hatchie to Bolivar.</p>

                <p>Now the other pioneer settler, Ezekiel Polk, had three grandsons: John Polk Campbell and his
                    brothers,
                    William C. and Ezekiel, all of whom moved to Missouri and settled in an area that later became
                    Greene
                    County. In 1835, plans were made to create a new county out of the northern part of Greene. The
                    Campbell
                    brothers submitted the name of Polk for the new county after the family of their grandfather,
                    Ezekiel
                    Polk. Since the majority of the settlers had also come from Tennessee, many having been friends and
                    acquaintances back there, it seems that there was no opposition to their suggestion for a name.
                    Therefore, the Missouri General Assembly acted to have the county of Polk organized.</p>
                <div id="courtHouse"><img src="images/courtHouse320.jpg" alt="Polk County Court House" width="320"
                        height="242"></div>
                <p> Next followed the search for a suitable location in which to place the county seat of justice. While
                    that was in progress, the Campbell brothers came forward with a name for the forthcoming village—the
                    same name as that of the county seat of Hardeman County, TN, where their grandfather Polk was
                    living—Bolivar. That would be an ideal name! Because like that of Washington, it symbolized
                    liberation.
                    Bolivar, Polk County—the two names went together well because Ezekiel Polk had distinguished himself
                    as
                    a colonel in George Washington’s Revolutionary Army. Public opinion appears to have been unanimous
                    in
                    favor of the name Bolivar since the minutes of the county court on Nov. 10, 1835, simply state that
                    the
                    seat of justice shall be called Bolivar.</p>
