                    Quitting is hard!
                    If you know or believe that you are addicted to any of these substances you have experienced many
                    overwhelming challenges. Perhaps you have tried to quit or diet before, maybe many times. The
                    craving never left and eventually you were back on again. You are far from alone. You will like what
                    you will read here. Does yet another diet or trying to quit your adiction again scare you because
                    one more failure may be one too many? Your family, friends, boss and others don’t believe you any
                    more. If food is your addiction you need a diet from dieting. Where most rehab success rates are
                    extremely low our techniques have above an 80% success rate. In the past you probably heard that you
                    don’t have enough self control. The diet, addiction and craving challenge requires more than self
                    control, more than an individual can muster from within. You need a way to reduce the cravings and
                    get you back to where you were before the cravings became part of your life. The residential rehabs
                    require a 30 day or longer stay and you cannot be away from work for that long. We agree and besides
                    that, when you are finished you have to go back home. Although you have changed your normal
                    circumstances are still the same. What was possible in the facility will be harder on your own. Your
                    transition does not have to be that way. And there is the cost of a residential rehab program,
                    especially the elite facilities that promise success. You need an option that is within financial
                    reach.

                    HealthyHope.Life uses amino acid supplements, vitamins and minerals
                    to reduce and in many cases remove the cravings. Without the cravings you are more in control. Our
                    program is conducted virtually so you don’t have to leave your job or home. You will learn how to
                    function in your normal surroundings. Because you are not staying at an expensive facility you are
                    only paying for the consultation and health protocol prepared specifically for you and any
                    supplements, vitamins or minerals we recommend. The supplements are only used to get you past the
                    cravings and healthy enough that your biochemistry can begin producing what is needed for a healthy
                    body. Of course we will be teaching you about the foods that your body needs to stay healthy.

                    Real Food vs Fake Food
                    Food is amazing art. Sizzling grass-fed steak on a grill, broiled pasture raised chicken drizzled
                    with coconut aminos. Roasted vegetables, fresh garden lettuce splashed balsamic vinegar and olive
                    oil, crisp apples and juicy oranges and a tall glass of real whole milk with cream running down the
                    side. These are examples of fresh, real food, full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants. Vs Cheerios
                    with skim milk and toast spread with margarine, sugar laden cookies, pastries and donuts made with
                    shortening, Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) raised meat full of antibiotics, factory raised
                    chicken eggs, processed meat with nitrates, vegetable oil, white rice, pasta and flour, high
                    fructose corn syrup is ketchup, soda, and so much more. Sugar, Sugar, Sugar. The Standard American
                    Diet (SAD) is the cause of illness from heart disease to diabetes to arthritis and mental illness.
                    Stress and poor nutritional intake combined with sedentary lives equals poor health. The solution IS
                    a lifestyle change which gives a person the chance for health, longevity and well-being.
                    HealthyHope.Life not only promotes REAL, whole food, but shares how to prepare it and explores the
                    joy of eating well. The joy of food, the joy of cooking and the joy of creating food that is
                    medicine and improves blood pressure, arteries, pain, and so much more.
